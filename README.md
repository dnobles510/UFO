# UFO

# Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to create a very in depth analysis of UFO sightings within the first two weeks in January of 2010. This analysis was created using JavaScript which allowed me to create a webpage and store my data in a table on the page. Because there was a lot of table, I created a filter that would filter through most categories to get specific information. The filters can be used to filter dates, cities, countries, states and shapes. The filter was a nice touch to the webpage because it allows for better navigation and filtering through all the data.

# Results
This webpage is very easy to navigate through because of the search engine. If you are looking for UFO sightings from a specific state, for instance california, you would type that into the state filter and those are the only UFO sightings you would be able to see.

Another option for filtering the data could be the country filter. It is a much more narrow filter than the state filter but it still very accurate if you are looking for UFO sightings in another country. You would just type which country you are looking for, (for instance I used Canada), and the UFO's in Canada were the only UFO's that generated from that filter.

# Summary 
Overall the design of this webpage is generaly very easy to use. One drawback of this design would be how long the data table is with no fillers on the side. Maybe some additional pictures on the sides of the table after the filter search would have made looking through the data a bit more appealing. With every project comes critique and the two things I would do differently on this webpage would be to add a drop list to every search with all the available data so users would have an easier time looking through the data without physically scrolling through the entire table. Another small thing I would adjust would be adding a search criteria for the 'duration' row. I think that would also be a helpful filter choice.
